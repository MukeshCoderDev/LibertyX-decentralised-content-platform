The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software to do everything you might do with the software that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright in it for any permitted purpose. However, you may only distribute the software according to [Distribution License](#distribution-license) and make changes or new works based on the software according to [Changes and New Works License](#changes-and-new-works-license).

## Distribution License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to distribute copies of the software. Your license to distribute covers distributing the software with changes and new works permitted by [Changes and New Works License](#changes-and-new-works-license).

## Notices

You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of the software from you also gets a copy of these terms.

If you modify the software, you must include in any modified copies of the software prominent notices stating that you have modified the software.

## Changes and New Works License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to make changes and new works based on the software for any permitted purpose.

## Patent License

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able to license, that you would infringe by using the software.

## Noncompete

Any purpose is a permitted purpose, except for providing any product that competes with the software or any product the licensor or any of its affiliates provides using the software.

## Competition

Goods and services compete even when they provide functionality through different kinds of interfaces or for different technical platforms. Applications can compete with services, libraries with plugins, frameworks with development tools, and so on, even if they're written in different programming languages or for different computer architectures. Goods and services compete even when provided free of charge. If you market goods or services as alternatives to the software or any product the licensor or any of its affiliates provides using the software, they compete.

## New Products

If you are using the software to provide a product, you may not use this license to start providing a new product, unless your new product is not competitive and you have been using this license for that use case for at least 12 months.

## Discontinued Products

You may begin or continue using the software to provide a competitive product, if the licensor or the relevant affiliate has not provided that product for more than two years.

## Personal Uses

Personal use for research, experiment, and testing for the benefit of public knowledge, personal study, private entertainment, hobby projects, amateur pursuits, or religious observance, without any anticipated commercial application, doesn't count as use to provide a product.

## Noncommercial Organizations

Use by any charitable organization, educational institution, public research organization, public safety or health organization, environmental protection organization, or government institution doesn't count as use to provide a product regardless of the source of funding or obligations resulting from the funding.

## Fair Use

You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the law. These terms do not limit them.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else. These terms do not imply any other licenses.

## Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on behalf of your company.

## Violations

The first time you are notified in writing that you have violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless continue if you come into full compliance with these terms, and take practical steps to correct past violations, within 32 days of receiving notice. Otherwise, all your licenses end immediately.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.***
