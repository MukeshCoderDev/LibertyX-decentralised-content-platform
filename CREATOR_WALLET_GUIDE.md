# üîë Creator Wallet Integration Guide

## Overview

LibertyX now supports **creator-funded uploads** where each creator uses their own Arweave wallet to pay for permanent video storage. This ensures the platform remains decentralized and sustainable while giving creators full control over their content costs.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Creators

1. **Get an Arweave Wallet**
   - Install [ArConnect](https://arconnect.io) browser extension
   - Or create a wallet at [arweave.app/wallet](https://arweave.app/wallet)
   - Export your keyfile (JSON format)

2. **Fund Your Wallet**
   - Buy AR tokens from exchanges (Binance, KuCoin, Gate.io)
   - Or use Uniswap if you have ETH
   - Transfer AR to your wallet address

3. **Upload Content**
   - Go to Upload page
   - Upload your wallet keyfile
   - Select your video
   - Review costs and upload!

### Cost Estimation

- **Small video (50MB)**: ~0.001 AR (~$0.02)
- **Medium video (200MB)**: ~0.004 AR (~$0.08)
- **Large video (500MB)**: ~0.010 AR (~$0.20)

*Prices are estimates and vary with network demand*

// Auto-cleanup on unmount
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    if (wallet) {
      console.log('üßπ Auto-clearing wallet on unmount');
      setWallet(null);
    }
  };
}, [wallet]);

2. **Balance Check**: Verify sufficient AR tokens
3. **Cost Estimation**: Calculate upload cost based on file size
4. **Transaction Creation**: Create Arweave transaction
5. **Signing**: Sign with creator's wallet
6. **Upload**: Post to Arweave network
7. **Confirmation**: Wait for network confirmation

## üìä Cost Breakdown

### File Size vs Cost
| File Size | Estimated Cost | USD Equivalent* |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| 10MB      | 0.0002 AR     | $0.004         |
| 50MB      | 0.001 AR      | $0.02          |
| 100MB     | 0.002 AR      | $0.04          |
| 200MB     | 0.004 AR      | $0.08          |
| 500MB     | 0.010 AR      | $0.20          |

*USD prices are estimates based on current AR token price
