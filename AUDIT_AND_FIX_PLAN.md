# Code Audit and Fix Plan for GitHub Push

## Overview
Based on the TypeScript compilation errors, we need to fix 256 errors across 81 files before the code is ready for GitHub. Here's a systematic approach to get your blockchain integration project production-ready.

## Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. Import and Module Resolution Issues
- **Missing contract artifacts**: Contract ABI imports are failing
- **Incorrect import paths**: Several components have wrong import paths
- **Unused imports**: Many files have unused imports that should be cleaned up

### 2. Type Safety Issues
- **Ethers.js v6 compatibility**: Using old v5 syntax in several places
- **Missing type definitions**: Several interfaces and types are incomplete
- **Property access errors**: Accessing non-existent properties on objects

### 3. Component Props Issues
- **Missing required props**: Many components are missing required properties
- **Type mismatches**: String/number type conflicts in component props

### 4. Hook and Context Issues
- **Missing hook implementations**: Several custom hooks are incomplete
- **Context type mismatches**: WalletContext has type inconsistencies

## Fix Priority Order

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (High Priority)
1. Fix contract artifact imports and paths
2. Update ethers.js v6 compatibility
3. Fix WalletProvider and ContractManager types
4. Resolve core hook implementations

### Phase 2: Component Fixes (Medium Priority)
1. Fix component prop types and required properties
2. Resolve import path issues
3. Clean up unused imports and variables

### Phase 3: Test Fixes (Low Priority)
1. Fix test component props and mocks
2. Update test utilities for new types
3. Clean up test-specific type issues
