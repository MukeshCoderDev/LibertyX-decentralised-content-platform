# YouTube-Style Comment System Requirements

## Introduction

The current comment system has a critical issue where users can type comments and click "Comment" but nothing happens - the comment doesn't appear and there's no feedback. This fails to meet YouTube standards where comments should immediately appear after posting with proper user feedback.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Immediate Comment Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want my comment to appear immediately after clicking "Comment" so that I can see my contribution to the discussion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a comment and clicks "Comment" THEN the comment SHALL appear immediately in the comments list
2. WHEN a comment is posted THEN the comment input field SHALL be cleared automatically
3. WHEN a comment is posted THEN the user SHALL see visual feedback (loading state, then success)
4. WHEN a comment is posted THEN the comment count SHALL update immediately

### Requirement 2: Optimistic UI Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my comment immediately even while it's being processed on the blockchain so that the interface feels responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a comment THEN the comment SHALL appear immediately with a "pending" indicator
2. WHEN the blockchain transaction completes THEN the "pending" indicator SHALL be removed
3. IF the blockchain transaction fails THEN the comment SHALL show an error state with retry option
4. WHEN a comment is pending THEN it SHALL be visually distinguished from confirmed comments

### Requirement 3: Real-time Comment Loading

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see existing comments when I open the comment section so that I can read the discussion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the comment section loads THEN existing comments SHALL be displayed immediately
2. WHEN there are no comments THEN a friendly message SHALL encourage the first comment
3. WHEN comments are loading THEN a loading indicator SHALL be shown
4. WHEN new comments are posted by others THEN they SHALL appear automatically

### Requirement 4: Comment Interaction Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with comments through likes, replies, and reporting so that I can engage with the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks like on a comment THEN the like count SHALL update immediately
2. WHEN a user clicks reply THEN a reply input SHALL appear below the comment
3. WHEN a user submits a reply THEN it SHALL appear nested under the parent comment
4. WHEN a user reports a comment THEN they SHALL receive confirmation feedback

### Requirement 5: User Experience Enhancements

**User Story:** As a user, I want a smooth and intuitive comment experience similar to YouTube so that I feel comfortable using the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is not connected THEN they SHALL see a clear message to connect their wallet
2. WHEN a user hovers over interactive elements THEN they SHALL see appropriate hover states
3. WHEN a comment is too long THEN it SHALL be truncated with "Show more" option
4. WHEN the comment section is empty THEN it SHALL show an engaging empty state
5. WHEN a user's comment fails THEN they SHALL see a clear error message with retry option

### Requirement 6: Performance and Responsiveness
