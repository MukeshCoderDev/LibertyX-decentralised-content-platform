# Task 4: Creator Registration and Profile Management System - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for Task 4, focusing on building the creator registration and profile management system. This system will enable users to register as creators on the platform, manage their profiles, and display their information, including KYC verification status and earnings.

## Objectives
*   Implement a user-friendly creator registration form.
*   Integrate with the `CreatorRegistry` smart contract for on-chain registration and profile updates.
*   Develop components for displaying creator profiles, including their KYC status and earnings.

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### 1. Creator Registration Form
**Description:** Create a React component for the creator registration form, allowing users to input their handle, avatar URI, and bio.
**Components:**
    *   `components/CreatorRegistrationForm.tsx` (New Component)
**Functionalities:**
    *   Input fields for `handle`, `avatarURI`, and `bio`.
    *   Validation for input fields (e.g., handle uniqueness, URI format).
    *   "Register" button to trigger the on-chain registration process.
**Integration Points:**
    *   Utilize `WalletProvider` for connected wallet address.
    *   Utilize `ContractManager` to interact with `CreatorRegistry` contract.

### 2. `CreatorRegistry` Contract Integration
**Description:** Implement the logic to interact with the `CreatorRegistry` smart contract for registering new creators and updating existing profiles.
**Files to Modify/Create:**
    *   `lib/contractUtils.ts` (Ensure `CreatorRegistryABI` is correctly imported and used)
    *   `lib/ContractManager.ts` (Already handles `creatorRegistry` contract instance)
    *   `hooks/useCreatorRegistry.ts` (New Custom Hook - for cleaner contract interactions)
**Functionalities:**
    *   `registerCreator(handle: string, avatarURI: string, bio: string)`: Calls the `registerCreator` function on the `CreatorRegistry` contract.
    *   `updateProfile(avatarURI: string, bio: string)`: Calls the `updateProfile` function on the `CreatorRegistry` contract.
    *   `getCreator(address: string)`: Reads creator details from the `CreatorRegistry` contract.
**Error Handling:**
    *   Implement robust error handling for contract interactions (e.g., transaction rejections, network errors).
    *   Provide user-friendly feedback for successful registrations/updates and failures.

### 3. KYC Verification Status Display and Management
**Description:** Integrate the display of KYC verification status into creator profiles.
**Files to Modify/Create:**
    *   `components/CreatorProfile.tsx` (New Component or enhance existing `CreatorDashboard.tsx`)
    *   `lib/web3-types.ts` (Ensure `Creator` interface includes `kycStatus`)
**Functionalities:**
    *   Display `kycStatus` (e.g., 'pending', 'verified', 'rejected') on the creator's profile.
    *   (Future consideration: Implement a mechanism for creators to initiate KYC, if applicable, or for platform admins to update status).

### 4. Creator Profile Viewing
**Description:** Develop a dedicated page or section for viewing creator profiles, displaying their registered information, KYC status, and earnings.
**Components:**
    *   `components/CreatorProfile.tsx` (New Component) or enhance `components/CreatorDashboard.tsx`
**Functionalities:**
    *   Fetch and display creator's handle, avatar, bio.
    *   Display KYC verification status.
    *   Integrate with `RevenueSplitter` or other relevant contracts to display earnings information (total, available, pending).
    *   Show content count, follower count (if applicable).

## Dependencies
*   **Task 3 Completion:** Smart contracts must be deployed and `lib/blockchainConfig.ts` must be up-to-date.
*   **Wallet Connection System:** `WalletProvider` must be functional for users to connect their wallets.
*   **`ContractManager`:** The `ContractManager` class must be correctly initialized and capable of providing contract instances.

## Success Criteria
*   A user can successfully register as a creator via the frontend.
*   A creator can update their profile information (avatar, bio).
*   Creator profiles accurately display registered information, including KYC status and earnings.
*   All blockchain interactions are handled gracefully with appropriate loading states and error messages.
