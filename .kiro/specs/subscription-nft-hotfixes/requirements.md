# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LibertyX platform is experiencing critical issues with subscription and NFT functionality where users see "Subscription contract not available" errors and empty states for NFT tiers. The application is stuck in loading states because the subscription manager and NFT access contracts are not properly deployed or configured. These are production-critical hot fixes needed to restore subscription and NFT functionality without requiring a complete redesign.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a creator, I want to create and manage subscription plans, so that I can earn recurring revenue from my fans.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a creator navigates to the subscription management section THEN the system SHALL successfully load the subscription contract
2. WHEN the subscription contract is not available THEN the system SHALL display a clear message about contract deployment status
3. WHEN a creator sets a subscription price and duration THEN the system SHALL successfully create the subscription plan
4. WHEN a creator has an existing plan THEN the system SHALL display the current plan details correctly
5. WHEN contract deployment is needed THEN the system SHALL provide instructions or deploy contracts automatically
6. WHEN on Sepolia testnet THEN the system SHALL use properly deployed subscription contract addresses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a fan, I want to subscribe to creators and view subscription status, so that I can access exclusive content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a fan views a creator profile THEN the system SHALL display available subscription plans
2. WHEN a fan clicks subscribe THEN the system SHALL process the subscription payment successfully
3. WHEN a fan has an active subscription THEN the system SHALL display subscription status and expiry date
4. WHEN subscription data is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states instead of getting stuck
5. WHEN subscription expires THEN the system SHALL update the status and offer renewal options
6. WHEN subscription fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a creator, I want to create NFT access tiers, so that I can offer exclusive content to NFT holders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a creator navigates to NFT tier management THEN the system SHALL successfully load the NFT access contract
2. WHEN the NFT access contract is not available THEN the system SHALL display deployment status and next steps
3. WHEN a creator creates an NFT tier THEN the system SHALL successfully deploy the tier with metadata and pricing
4. WHEN NFT tiers exist THEN the system SHALL display tier statistics including holders and minted amounts
5. WHEN no tiers exist THEN the system SHALL show a helpful empty state with creation options
6. WHEN contract interaction fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a fan, I want to mint NFTs and view my NFT collection, so that I can access tier-based exclusive content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a fan views creator NFT tiers THEN the system SHALL display available tiers with pricing and availability
2. WHEN a fan mints an NFT THEN the system SHALL process the payment and mint transaction successfully
3. WHEN a fan owns NFTs THEN the system SHALL display their NFT collection with proper metadata
4. WHEN NFT access is checked THEN the system SHALL correctly validate ownership for content access
5. WHEN minting fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
6. WHEN NFTs are loading THEN the system SHALL show loading states instead of empty states

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want properly deployed and configured contracts, so that subscription and NFT functionality works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate that required contracts are deployed on the current network
2. WHEN contracts are missing THEN the system SHALL either deploy them automatically or provide deployment instructions
3. WHEN contract addresses are placeholders THEN the system SHALL replace them with real deployed contract addresses
4. WHEN on different networks THEN the system SHALL use network-specific contract addresses
5. WHEN contract deployment fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and provide fallback options
6. WHEN contracts are deployed THEN the system SHALL verify they are working correctly with test transactions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want immediate feedback and proper error handling for subscription and NFT operations, so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN subscription operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators with descriptive text
2. WHEN NFT operations are pending THEN the system SHALL display progress with estimated completion times
3. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL provide clear success feedback with transaction details
4. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL offer specific troubleshooting steps and retry options
5. WHEN contracts are unavailable THEN the system SHALL explain the issue and provide next steps
6. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL detect and handle them gracefully with user-friendly messages
