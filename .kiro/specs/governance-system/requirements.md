# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LibertyX governance system enables token holders to participate in decentralized decision-making for the platform. This system allows LIB token holders to create, vote on, and execute proposals that affect platform operations, parameters, and future development. The governance system integrates with the deployed LibertyToken (0x12bdF4aEB6F85bEc7c55de6c418f5d88e9203319) and LibertyDAO (0x1e1e418F9a1eE0e887Bd6Ba8CbeCD07C6B1e1FcA) contracts on Sepolia testnet.
