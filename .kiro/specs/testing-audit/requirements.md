# Testing and Audit Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for comprehensive testing and auditing of the completed blockchain integration features (tasks 17-19) for the open source decentralized content platform. The focus is on ensuring code quality, security, performance, and maintainability for public GitHub release.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Quality and Standards Compliance

**User Story:** As an open source contributor, I want the codebase to follow consistent standards and best practices, so that I can easily understand and contribute to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is analyzed THEN all TypeScript files SHALL have proper type definitions without any 'any' types
2. WHEN ESLint is run THEN there SHALL be zero linting errors or warnings
3. WHEN code is reviewed THEN all functions SHALL have proper JSDoc documentation
4. WHEN components are analyzed THEN all React components SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
5. WHEN imports are checked THEN all unused imports SHALL be removed
6. WHEN code complexity is measured THEN no function SHALL exceed 20 lines or 3 levels of nesting

### Requirement 2: Security Vulnerability Assessment

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want my data and transactions to be secure, so that I can trust the platform with my digital assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN smart contract interactions are tested THEN all contract calls SHALL have proper error handling
2. WHEN user input is processed THEN all inputs SHALL be properly sanitized and validated
3. WHEN private keys are handled THEN they SHALL never be logged or exposed in client code
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN all external requests SHALL use HTTPS and proper authentication
5. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN it SHALL be encrypted or stored securely
6. WHEN dependencies are scanned THEN there SHALL be no known security vulnerabilities

### Requirement 3: Functional Testing Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are run THEN all critical functions SHALL have at least 80% code coverage
2. WHEN integration tests are executed THEN all blockchain interactions SHALL be properly mocked and tested
3. WHEN component tests are run THEN all React components SHALL render without errors
4. WHEN user flows are tested THEN all major user journeys SHALL be covered by end-to-end tests
5. WHEN edge cases are tested THEN error scenarios SHALL be properly handled and tested
6. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL complete in under 30 seconds for the full suite

### Requirement 4: Performance and Optimization Analysis

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want fast and responsive interactions, so that I can efficiently use the platform features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN page load times are measured THEN initial load SHALL be under 3 seconds
2. WHEN bundle size is analyzed THEN JavaScript bundles SHALL be optimized and tree-shaken
3. WHEN blockchain operations are performed THEN gas usage SHALL be optimized for cost efficiency
4. WHEN components render THEN there SHALL be no unnecessary re-renders or memory leaks
5. WHEN images and assets are loaded THEN they SHALL be properly optimized and cached
6. WHEN network requests are made THEN they SHALL be batched and optimized where possible

### Requirement 5: Accessibility and Usability Compliance

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want the platform to be accessible, so that I can use all features regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessibility is tested THEN all components SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
2. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible via keyboard
3. WHEN screen readers are used THEN all content SHALL have proper ARIA labels and descriptions
4. WHEN color contrast is measured THEN all text SHALL meet minimum contrast ratios
5. WHEN forms are used THEN all form fields SHALL have proper labels and error messages
6. WHEN focus is managed THEN focus indicators SHALL be visible and logical

### Requirement 6: Documentation and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a new contributor, I want clear documentation and maintainable code, so that I can quickly understand and contribute to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN README is reviewed THEN it SHALL contain clear setup and contribution instructions
2. WHEN API documentation is checked THEN all public functions SHALL be documented with examples
3. WHEN architecture is reviewed THEN system design SHALL be documented with diagrams
4. WHEN deployment is tested THEN deployment instructions SHALL be accurate and complete
5. WHEN code is analyzed THEN complex logic SHALL have inline comments explaining the reasoning
6. WHEN dependencies are reviewed THEN all dependencies SHALL be justified and up-to-date
