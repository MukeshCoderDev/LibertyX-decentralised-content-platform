# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LibertyX application is experiencing critical contract integration issues where users encounter "CreatorRegistry contract not found" errors when trying to access creator profiles. The application shows "Unable to Load Profile" with contract-related error messages, preventing users from accessing core functionality. These are production-critical hot fixes needed to restore basic application functionality without requiring a complete redesign.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user trying to view a creator profile, I want the CreatorRegistry contract to be properly initialized and accessible, so that I can view creator information without encountering contract errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the Creator Profile page THEN the system SHALL successfully initialize the CreatorRegistry contract
2. WHEN the CreatorRegistry contract is not found THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect to the blockchain network
3. WHEN contract initialization fails THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message with troubleshooting steps
4. WHEN the "Try Again" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL retry contract initialization up to 3 times
5. WHEN contract connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically load the creator profile data
6. WHEN on Sepolia Testnet THEN the system SHALL use the correct contract addresses for the test environment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with a connected wallet, I want the contract manager to properly detect my network and initialize contracts, so that all Web3 functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a wallet is connected THEN the system SHALL verify the current network matches supported networks
2. WHEN the network is unsupported THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to switch to a supported network
3. WHEN contracts are not deployed on the current network THEN the system SHALL display a clear message about network compatibility
4. WHEN switching networks THEN the system SHALL reinitialize all contract instances for the new network
5. WHEN contract addresses are missing THEN the system SHALL provide fallback behavior or mock data for development
6. WHEN blockchain connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling for contract failures, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it instead of seeing generic error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a contract call fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages instead of technical errors
2. WHEN the wallet is not connected THEN the system SHALL show a "Connect Wallet" prompt instead of contract errors
3. WHEN gas estimation fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative gas price suggestions
4. WHEN a transaction is rejected THEN the system SHALL explain why and offer retry options
5. WHEN network congestion occurs THEN the system SHALL inform users about delays and provide estimated wait times
6. WHEN contract interaction succeeds THEN the system SHALL show clear confirmation messages with transaction hashes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust contract initialization and error recovery, so that the application can handle various blockchain network conditions gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required contract addresses are configured
2. WHEN contract initialization fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
3. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide mock contract responses if real contracts are unavailable
4. WHEN contract ABIs are outdated THEN the system SHALL detect version mismatches and alert developers
5. WHEN multiple contract calls are needed THEN the system SHALL batch them efficiently to reduce network requests
6. WHEN contract state changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI reactively without requiring page refreshes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work seamlessly across different blockchain networks, so that I can use the platform regardless of which supported network I'm connected to.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connected to Ethereum mainnet THEN the system SHALL use mainnet contract addresses
2. WHEN connected to Polygon THEN the system SHALL use Polygon contract addresses  
3. WHEN connected to Sepolia testnet THEN the system SHALL use testnet contract addresses
4. WHEN switching between networks THEN the system SHALL preserve user session and reload contract data
5. WHEN a network has no deployed contracts THEN the system SHALL inform users which networks are supported
6. WHEN contract versions differ between networks THEN the system SHALL handle feature compatibility gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want immediate feedback when contract operations are in progress, so that I know the system is working and not frozen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading creator profiles THEN the system SHALL show loading spinners with descriptive text
2. WHEN contract transactions are pending THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators with estimated completion times
3. WHEN retrying failed operations THEN the system SHALL show retry attempt counters
4. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL provide clear success feedback
5. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL offer specific next steps to resolve the issue
6. WHEN multiple operations are queued THEN the system SHALL show overall progress status
