# Implementation Plan

## Critical Hot Fixes for Contract Integration Issues

- [x] 1. Fix CreatorRegistry contract initialization error

  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 4.2_

- [ ] 3. Improve user error messaging and feedback
  - Replace technical "CreatorRegistry contract not found" with user-friendly messages
  - Add specific troubleshooting steps for common contract errors
  - Implement loading states for contract initialization
  - Create retry button functionality with attempt counters
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 6.1, 6.3_

- [ ] 4. Add network compatibility validation
  - Verify current network has deployed contracts before attempting initialization
  - Prompt users to switch networks when contracts are not available
  - Display supported networks list when user is on unsupported chain
  - Handle network switching gracefully with contract reinitialization
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5_

- [ ] 5. Implement development mode fallbacks
  - Add mock contract responses for development when real contracts unavailable
  - Create development-only bypass for contract requirements
  - Add environment detection to enable/disable mock mode
  - Provide realistic mock data for creator profiles and other contract calls
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.1_

- [ ] 6. Add contract health monitoring
  - Implement contract availability checking before making calls
  - Add periodic health checks for contract connectivity
  - Create contract status dashboard for debugging

  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.6_

- [ ] 7. Enhance wallet connection error handling
  - Add proper error handling for wallet not connected scenarios
  - Implement automatic wallet reconnection after network changes
  - Create clear prompts for wallet connection when required
  - Handle wallet disconnection gracefully without breaking contract calls
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 2.2_

- [ ] 8. Implement progressive loading and caching
  - Add loading spinners with descriptive text for contract operations
  - Cache successful contract responses to reduce blockchain calls
