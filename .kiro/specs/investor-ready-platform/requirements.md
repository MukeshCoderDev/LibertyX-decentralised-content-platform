# Requirements Document

## Introduction

LibertyX is a decentralized content platform that has been in development for 2 months. The core infrastructure is deployed and working, but needs final polish to be investor-ready. The platform currently has a deployed CreatorRegistry contract on Sepolia testnet and a functional frontend, but users are experiencing "Unable to Load Profile" errors that prevent smooth onboarding. This feature focuses on creating a seamless, professional user experience that demonstrates the platform's value to potential investors and creators.

## Requirements

2. WHEN the platform connects to Sepolia testnet THEN the system SHALL use the deployed contract address 0x28bCAB7F0458CE2ae28c6072E0bE5722A0dCEdCe
3. WHEN there are network connectivity issues THEN the system SHALL show helpful error messages with clear next steps
4. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL maintain connection state and not show loading errors

### Requirement 2

5. WHEN a user has insufficient gas THEN the system SHALL estimate gas costs and suggest getting more ETH

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want clear visual feedback about my connection status and account state, so that I understand what's happening at all times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is connected to the wrong network THEN the system SHALL show a prominent network switch prompt

5. WHEN the user is on Sepolia testnet THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this is a test environment

### Requirement 4

2. WHEN the platform loads THEN the system SHALL not show any console errors or warnings
3. WHEN users interact with forms THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation feedback
4. WHEN the platform is in development mode THEN the system SHALL include helpful debug information
5. WHEN the platform handles edge cases THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality rather than breaking

### Requirement 5
