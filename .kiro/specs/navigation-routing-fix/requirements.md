# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The navigation system in the LibertyX application has critical issues where clicking on navigation links (Wallet Profile, Explore, Upload, Dashboard, etc.) from certain pages (particularly the Gamification page) causes the page to become unresponsive. Users are unable to navigate between different sections of the application, which severely impacts the user experience and makes the application unusable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing the Gamification page, I want to be able to click on any navigation link in the header, so that I can seamlessly navigate to other sections of the application without the page becoming unresponsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on "Explore" from the Gamification page THEN the system SHALL navigate to the Explore page within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a user clicks on "Upload" from the Gamification page THEN the system SHALL navigate to the Upload page within 2 seconds
3. WHEN a user clicks on "Dashboard" from the Gamification page THEN the system SHALL navigate to the Dashboard page within 2 seconds
4. WHEN a user clicks on "Creator Profile" from the Gamification page THEN the system SHALL navigate to the Creator Profile page within 2 seconds
5. WHEN a user clicks on "Governance" from the Gamification page THEN the system SHALL navigate to the Governance page within 2 seconds
6. WHEN a user clicks on "Wallet Profile" from the Gamification page THEN the system SHALL navigate to the Wallet Profile page within 2 seconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user on any page of the application, I want navigation links to work consistently, so that I can move between different sections without encountering unresponsive behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks any navigation link from any page THEN the system SHALL NOT display "Page Unresponsive" dialogs
2. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL properly clean up any running processes or event listeners from the previous page
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL load the new page without blocking the main thread
4. IF a navigation takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator instead of becoming unresponsive

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation system to handle route changes efficiently, so that the application remains responsive during page transitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a route change is initiated THEN the system SHALL cancel any pending asynchronous operations from the current page
2. WHEN a route change occurs THEN the system SHALL properly unmount React components and clean up their state
3. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent header state and styling
4. WHEN a navigation error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message instead of becoming unresponsive

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the routing system to be robust and debuggable, so that navigation issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation events occur THEN the system SHALL log relevant debugging information to the console
2. WHEN navigation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the cause
3. WHEN route changes happen THEN the system SHALL properly update the browser URL and history
4. IF memory leaks occur during navigation THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent them through proper cleanup
