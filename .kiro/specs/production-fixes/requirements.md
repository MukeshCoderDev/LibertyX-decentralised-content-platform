# Production Fixes Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LibertyX application has been successfully deployed to Netlify and the UI is working perfectly. The design and functionality are exactly as desired. However, there are two critical console errors that need to be fixed to ensure the application runs without technical issues in production.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Tailwind CSS Console Warning

**User Story:** As a developer monitoring the application, I want to eliminate the Tailwind CDN warning in the console, so that the application follows production best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads in production THEN there SHALL be no "cdn.tailwindcss.com should not be used in production" warnings in the console
2. WHEN the application is built THEN Tailwind CSS SHALL be properly configured for production use
3. WHEN the styling loads THEN it SHALL maintain the exact same visual appearance as currently displayed
4. IF Tailwind classes are used THEN they SHALL continue to work exactly as they do now

### Requirement 2: Fix JavaScript "require is not defined" Error

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the application, I want all JavaScript functionality to work without console errors, so that the application runs smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN there SHALL be no "require is not defined" errors in the console
2. WHEN JavaScript modules are processed THEN they SHALL use proper browser-compatible module syntax
3. WHEN the application runs THEN all existing functionality SHALL continue to work exactly as it does now
4. IF there are CommonJS modules THEN they SHALL be properly converted to ES modules or polyfilled

### Requirement 3: Maintain Current UI and Functionality

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want all current features and visual design to remain exactly the same, so that my experience is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the visual design SHALL remain completely unchanged
2. WHEN the application loads THEN all navigation, cards, and UI elements SHALL look and behave exactly as they do now
3. WHEN users interact with the application THEN all current functionality SHALL continue to work
4. IF any changes are made THEN they SHALL only affect the underlying technical implementation, not the user experience
