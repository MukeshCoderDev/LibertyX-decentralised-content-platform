# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LibertyX platform is experiencing critical JavaScript errors in the live Netlify deployment that are preventing the application from functioning properly. The primary error is `(void 0) is not a function` occurring in the bundled JavaScript files, which typically indicates missing or undefined functions/modules. This feature will systematically identify, debug, and resolve these production errors to restore full functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the application to load and function without JavaScript errors, so that I can access all features and functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the deployed application THEN the application SHALL load without throwing JavaScript errors in the browser console
2. WHEN the application initializes THEN all core modules and functions SHALL be properly defined and accessible
3. WHEN users interact with the application THEN all features SHALL work as expected without runtime errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify the root cause of the `(void 0) is not a function` errors, so that I can implement targeted fixes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the error stack trace THEN the system SHALL identify which specific functions or modules are undefined
2. WHEN examining the build output THEN the system SHALL verify that all required dependencies are properly bundled
3. WHEN reviewing the source maps THEN the system SHALL map minified errors back to original source code locations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure proper module resolution and bundling, so that all dependencies are correctly included in the production build.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN all imported modules SHALL be properly resolved and included
2. WHEN using dynamic imports THEN they SHALL be handled correctly by the bundler
3. WHEN external dependencies are referenced THEN they SHALL be available in the runtime environment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement error monitoring and logging, so that I can quickly identify and respond to production issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with detailed context information
2. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL provide fallback behavior to maintain basic functionality
3. WHEN monitoring production THEN error rates and patterns SHALL be tracked and reported

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to validate the fix across different browsers and environments, so that I can ensure consistent functionality for all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the fixed application THEN it SHALL work correctly across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. WHEN deploying to production THEN the application SHALL maintain functionality across different network conditions
3. WHEN users access the application THEN performance SHALL not be degraded by the error fixes
